pages of their own, so be sure to visit those pages as well, if they're
relevant to your search. The listings are roughly organized by topic, with
introductory resources first, more general topics next, and discipline-specific
resources last.

Unless otherwise indicated, all packages listed here are provided under some
form of open source license.

If you distribute or know of a resource that is not listed here, please add a
listing. Make an account, login, visit the wiki. You'll now see an "edit" tab
at the top. Click it and go to it. If you need help, there is a help link at
the top of the page. Please follow the general format of the existing listings.
Be as brief as you can, but make sure you include in your text a link to the
resource's home page and some keywords that potential users might search for to
find the resource. Finally, when you have saved, check out your listing and
test the link to make sure it works.

If you wish to restructure the page (e.g., break out a section into its own
page, change the section headings, etc.), please propose the idea to the
SciPy-dev@scipy.org mailing list first and get community feedback.

  contains many advanced features not found in Pyrex, including very 
  natural support for `handling NumPy arrays 
  <http://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial/numpy.html>`_
  as well as the `PEP-3118 buffer protocol 
  <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/>`_. It is quite popular
  within the Python scientific computing community.

* `ctypes <http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html>`_ is a module in the
  Python standard library (bundled with Python 2.5 and later) that allows you
  to create and manipulate C data types in Python, and to call functions in
  dynamic link libraries/shared DLLs. It allows wrapping these libraries in
  pure Python. NumPy arrays include a ``ctypes`` property allowing easy passing
  of the arrays to code wrapped with ctypes. See the `cookbook entry
  <http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Ctypes>`_ for more information.

* `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`_: SWIG is a software development tool that
  connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level
  programming languages. SWIG is primarily used with common scripting languages

  See also Cython__.

__ cython-target_

* `PyCxx <http://cxx.sourceforge.net>`_: CXX/Objects is a set of C++ facilities
  to make it easier to write Python extensions. The chief way in which PyCXX
  makes it easier to write Python extensions is that it greatly increases the
  probability that your program will not make a reference-counting error and
  will not have to continually check error returns from the Python C API.

* `SIP <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/>`_: a tool for automatically
  generating `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ bindings for C and C++
  libraries. SIP was originally developed in 1998 for
  `PyQt <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/>`_, Python bindings
  for the Qt GUI toolkit, but is suitable for generating bindings for any C or
  C++ library.

Inlining C/C++
##############

  interface to the `R Programming Language <http://www.r-project.org/>`_. It
  can manage all kinds of R objects and can execute arbitrary R functions
  (including the graphic functions). All errors from the R language are
  converted to Python exceptions. Any module installed for the R system can be
  used from within Python.

MATLAB
######

* `mlabwrap <http://mlabwrap.sf.net/>`_: A high-level Python-to-MATLAB bridge.
  Instead of opening connections to the MATLAB engine and executing statements,
  MATLAB functions are exposed as Python functions and complicated structures
  as proxy objects.

* `pythoncall <http://www.iki.fi/pav/software/pythoncall/>`_ is a
  MATLAB-to-Python bridge. Runs a Python interpreter inside MATLAB, and allows
  transferring data (matrices etc.) between the Python and Matlab workspaces.

Converting Code From Other Array Languages
------------------------------------------

* `i2py <http://software.pseudogreen.org/i2py/>`_ converts code from
  IDL, the Interactive Data Language from ITT, into NumPy expressions.

* `pym <http://code.google.com/p/pym>`_ aims to translate MATLAB m-files into
  analogous NumPy statements (see "Source" tab, or `browse 
  <http://pym.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/>`_).

  each created data set.  For example: create all possible combination of
  datasets that represent the 'flow' variable with numbers from 10 to 20 by 2
  and the 'level' variable with 24 values taken from a normal distribution with
  a mean of 104 and standard deviation of 5.

  `Gnome <http://www.gnome.org/>`_ interface is available. It provides powerful
  editing capabilities, a nice hierarchical search mechanism, direct insertion
  of references into `LyX <http://www.lyx.org/>`_ and
  `Kile <http://kile.sourceforge.net/>`_, direct queries on Medline, and more.
  It currently supports the following file formats: BibTeX, ISI, Medline, Ovid,
  Refer.

* `py2tex <http://www.sollunae.net/py2tex>`_: format Python source code as
  LaTeX. Note that `this <http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/py2tex>`_ site
  contains an older release of the same code, don't be confused.

* `pyreport <http://gael-varoquaux.info/computers/pyreport>`_: runs a script
  and captures the output (pylab graphics included). Generates a LaTeX or pdf
  report out of it, including litteral comments and pretty printed code.

* `Vision Egg <http://visionegg.org>`_: produce stimuli for vision research
  experiments

* `PsychoPy <http://www.psychopy.org/>`_: a freeware library for vision
  research experiments (and analyse data) with an emphasis on psychophysics.

* `PyEPL <http://pyepl.sourceforge.net/>`_: the Python Experiment Programing
  Library. A free library to create experiments ranging from simple display of
  stimuli and recording of responses (including audio) to the creation of
  interactive virtual reality environments.

* `Pythonica <http://www.tildesoft.com/Pythonica.html>`_: a Python
  implementation of a symbolic math program, based upon the fantastic precedent
  set by Mathematica.

* `Module dependency graph <http://www.tarind.com/depgraph.html>`_:a few
  scripts to glue modulefinder.py into `graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org>`_,
  producing import dependency pictures pretty enough for use as a poster, and
  containing enough information to be a core part of my process for
  understanding physical dependencies.

* `Modular Toolkit for Data Processing (MDP) 
  <http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/>`_: a library to implement data 
  processing elements (nodes) and to combine them into data processing 
  sequences (flows). Already implemented nodes include Principal Component
  Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Slow Feature 
  Analysis (SFA), and Growing Neural Gas.

* `FiPy <http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/>`_: FiPy is an object
  oriented, partial differential equation (PDE) solver, written in Python ,
  based on a standard finite volume (FV) approach. The framework has been
  developed in the Metallurgy Division and Center for Theoretical and
  Computational Materials Science (CTCMS), in the Materials Science and
  Engineering Laboratory (MSEL) at the National Institute of Standards and
  Technology (NIST).

* `SfePy <http://sfepy.org>`_: SfePy is a finite element
  solver written in Python, with the time demanding parts implemented in C and
  interfaced by SWIG. It can be used to solve various problems described by
  partial differential equations in 2D or 3D, for example the linear
  elasticity, hyperelasticity, heat conduction, Navier-Stokes, Biot, and other
  problems. As a research code it is used to implement models derived by the
  theory of homogenization, with applications in modeling of porous media (for
  example bones or soft tissue organs) or phononic materials.

* `Hermes <http://hpfem.org>`_: Hermes is a free C++/Python
  library for rapid prototyping of adaptive FEM and hp-FEM solvers developed by
  an open source community around the hp-FEM group at the University of Nevada,
  Reno.

* `FEval <http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/feval>`_: FEval
  is useful for conversion between many finite element file formats. The main
  functionality is extraction of model data in the physical domain, for example
  to calculate flow lines.

* `CSC Climate Wiki <https://geodoc.uchicago.edu/climatewiki>`_: wiki for the
  `Climate Systems Center <http://climate.uchicago.edu/>`_ (CSC) at the
  University of Chicago. Topics include climate research, the philosophy of
  modularizing climate models, the use of Python in climate modeling, and
  software packages produced by CSC. This site contains a lot of useful
  information about Python for scientific computing.

* `peak-o-mat <http://lorentz.sf.net>`_: peak-o-mat is a curve fitting program
  for the spectrocopist. It is especially designed for batch cleaning,
  conversion and fitting of spectra from visibile optics expriments if you're
  facing a large number of similar spectra.

* `scalar <http://RussP.us/scalar.htm>`_: The scalar package is designed to
  represent physical scalars and to eliminate errors involving implicit
  physical units (e.g., confusing angular degrees and radians). It comes with a
  complete implementation of the standard metric system of units and many
  standard non-metric units. It also allows the user to easily define a
  specialized or reduced set of appropriate physical units for any particular
  application or domain. Once an application has been developed and tested, the
  scalar class can be switched off for production runs to achieve the execution
  efficiency of operations on built-in numeric types, which can be up to two
  orders of magnitude faster. A user guide is provided.
