We need your help!
------------------

This is a distributed, volunteer project with many contributors. The
best way to join our effort is to start participating in one of the
developer :doc:`mailing lists <mailing-lists>`.

Steering Committee
------------------

* Jarrod Millman
* Eric Jones
* Robert Kern
* Travis Oliphant
* Stefan van der Walt

The purpose of this group is to ensure coherency in the SciPy library and
advocate its progression. It organizes doc-days, bug-days, coding sprints, and
assists with organizing the SciPy conference. It also serves to resolve
questions that come up regarding the future of SciPy.

Source Code

Make contributions (e.g. code patches), feature requests and file bug reports 
by submitting a "ticket" on the Trac pages linked below.  Because of spam 
abuse, you must create an account on our Trac in order to submit a ticket, 
then click on the "New Ticket" tab that only appears when you have logged in.
Please give as much information as you can in the ticket.  Also specify the
component, the version you are referring to and the milestone.  Report bugs
to the appropriate Trac instance (there is one for NumPy and a different one
for SciPy).  There are read-only mailing lists for tracking the status of 
your bug ticket.

Note that NumPy contains the most basic numerical functionality, and SciPy is
layered on top of NumPy to provide a much wider range of capability. You need
NumPy for SciPy to work.

Interested people can get repository write access as well.  This usually 
requires a developer "vouching" for you, which happens more easily if you 
already made a number of patch contributions.

See :ref:`packaging`, below, for the process of building and making releases.

New Code
########

If you have some new code you'd like to see included in SciPy, the first 
thing to do is make a **SciKit**.

A SciKit is a stand-alone package including your code (including complete
reference and user documentation). SciKits are distributed at
http://scikits.appspot.com/. This site is currently still in early construction
phases, and will be moved (and linked) to the main page of this site when it is
ready to accept new SciKits. Right now users and developers are encouraged to
view the site and comment on scipy-dev@scipy.org to ensure it serves your
needs.

Once you get some use experience, the community may decide to include your
SciKit in SciPy. These decisions are based on many factors, including maturity
of the code API and the docs, ease of building it on all platforms, how many
people use it, how well it is integrated into SciPy, etc.

Because it must remain small and easy to build, new additions of entire
packages to NumPy are extremely rare. Post on
the numpy-discussion@scipy.org mailing list if you think you have a compelling
case.

Packaging
---------

For the majority of users who do not want to build the code from source, binary
installers that "just work" are the key to using SciPy. Producing these after
the coding is finished is the Packaging Team's job.

Making Source and Binary Releases
#################################

A releaseable tarball gets made from the sources following a straightforward
procedure (see http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/wiki/MakingReleases ). To make
an official release to the community, the release manager typically
makes a series of test releases and announces them on the
mailing lists. After getting feedback, the release manager makes a final release,
posts it, and announces it on the mailing lists.

Getting Releases Into Distribution
##################################

Linux distributions and many others pick up our packages and deliver them to
users as part of larger collections.
